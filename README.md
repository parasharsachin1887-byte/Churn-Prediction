# 🧠 Churn Prediction

### 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn — identifying customers likely to discontinue a service. The goal is to help businesses take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

### 💻 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### 🔍 Process
1. **Data Collection** – Used the Telco Customer Churn dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and normalized numerical features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized churn distribution and customer behavior patterns.  
4. **Model Building** – Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Measured performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

### 📊 Results
- Identified key churn factors such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.  
- Built a model with high prediction accuracy, providing business insights for customer retention.  

### 🚀 Future Scope
Enhance model performance using ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, and deploy it using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
