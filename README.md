# 🔐 Fraud Detection

### 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify abnormal patterns in transaction data and flag potential fraud cases effectively.

### 💻 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### 🔍 Process
1. **Dataset Used** – A publicly available ready-made dataset containing financial transaction records.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and standardized the dataset for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized transaction patterns to understand normal vs. fraudulent behaviors.  
4. **Model Building** – Applied the **Isolation Forest** algorithm to detect anomalies representing possible fraudulent transactions.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated results using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 📊 Results
- The Isolation Forest model effectively identified outliers corresponding to fraudulent activity.  
- Provided insights into the characteristics and frequency of suspicious transactions.

### 🚀 Future Scope
Incorporate other unsupervised techniques like One-Class SVM and Autoencoders, and deploy the model using Streamlit for interactive fraud detection visualization.
