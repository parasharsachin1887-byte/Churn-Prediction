# 🧠 Churn Prediction

### 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn — identifying customers likely to discontinue a service. The goal is to help businesses take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

### 💻 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### 🔍 Process
1. **Data Collection** – Used a customer dataset containing transaction and service information.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned missing data, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical values.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized churn distribution and identified customer behavior patterns.  
4. **Feature Selection** – Determined key features influencing churn such as:  
   - **Tenure** – Duration of customer relationship  
   - **Complaint Descends Last Order** – Frequency of customer complaints  
   - **Cashback Amount** – Total cashback received  
   - **Merity Status** – Loyalty or membership status  
5. **Model Building** – Applied Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.  
6. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated model accuracy and interpreted key churn indicators.

### 📊 Results
- Successfully identified churn-prone customers using behavioral and transactional patterns.  
- Lower tenure, frequent complaints, and lower cashback amounts were found to be strong churn indicators.

### 🚀 Future Scope
Enhance model performance using Random Forest and XGBoost, and deploy it using Streamlit for real-time churn prediction dashboards.
